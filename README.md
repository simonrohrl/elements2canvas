# Custom Chromium Mod

This project manages custom modifications to the Chromium browser using a **patch-based workflow**. Rather than forking the entire huge Chromium repository, we store only the specific changes (patches) and a set of automation scripts to apply them to official Chromium release tags.

## Project Structure

- `patches/`: Contains `.patch` files generated by `git diff`.
- `scripts/`: Automation scripts for downloading, syncing, and building.
- `.chromium-version`: A text file containing the target Chromium release tag (e.g., `145.0.7613.1`).

## System Requirements

Building Chromium is resource-intensive. Ensure your machine meets these minimums:

- **Disk Space:** 120GB+ free space (SSD strongly recommended).
- **RAM:** 16GB minimum (32GB+ recommended).
- **OS:** macOs (currently the setup is only targeted for macOs, other OSes will be supported soon)

## 0. Prerequisites

For building, you will need **Xcode** and **Homebrew**.

You will need to install `caffeinate` to prevent your machine from going to sleep during the fetch process.
```bash
brew install caffein

```
You will also need to install `ccache` to speed up subsequent builds.
```bash
brew install ccache
```

## 1. Initial Setup (Bootstrap)

Before building, you must download the Chromium source code and the Google `depot_tools` suite. This only needs to be done once.

```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

**Note:** This step will download huge amount of data. Depending on your connection, it may take an hour.

## 2. Workflow and Patching

### Making Changes
If you want to modify a new file or change your logic:
1. Navigate to `chromium/src`.
2. Modify the code and test the build.
3. Once satisfied, generate a new patch file:
   ```bash
   git diff > ../../patches/my-new-feature.patch
   ```
4. Commit the new patch file to this GitHub repository.

### Applying Patches
To apply the patches, run the apply patches script.
```bash
./scripts/apply-patches.sh
```

## 3. Building
To build the browser, run the build script. The first build will take several hours, but subsequent builds will be much faster.
```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

The compiled binary will be located at:
`chromium/src/out/Default/chrome`

## 4. Running
To run the browser, run the start script.
```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```
